# React and Ruby on Rails Web App
Welcome to -*Your Anime Database*-, a web Anime info based app made up using React for the client and a Ruby on Rails API.<br/>
This is an app where you can store and check data about your favourite series, their actors and characters, and even create a 'Favourite' list for either the animes and characters.<br/>
<br/>
With its design and search engine, it makes incredibly easy looking up for what you're looking for. It comes with a register and login system, where you can create your own user, modify your profile and, by becoming and admin, administrate all the info in the database.

### Need Source

<!-- ### First of all
To get this app running you'll need to *NodeJS*, *Ruby 2.6.8* with *Rails 6.1* and *PostgreSQL* (I use PostgreSQL 14).<br/>
Here you have some links:<br/>
[NodeJS Download](https://nodejs.org/es/)<br/>
[Ruby Download](https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)<br/>
[Ruby on Rails Installation Tutorial](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)<br/>
[PostgreSQL Download](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads)<br/>

### Get the app running
Once you have everything downloaded and installed you'll need to run a few things in the command prompt.<br/>
I recommend using the *Git Bash*. It's comfortable and shouldn't give you any problem.<br/>
[Git Download](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Backend
The Backend is created with Ruby on Rails and uses PostgreSQL for the database.<br/>
<br/>
In the *Backend* you need to run ```bundle install``` and ```rails db:setup```.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you will have to create a file called *application.yml* inside the *config* folder.<br/>
In that file, you will have to write the following:<br/>
```
development:
  host_postgres: your_host
  port_postgres: "your_port"
  username_postgres: your_user
  password_postgres: your_password
```
This is done this way for security reasons.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to insert some test data into the database I recomend using Postman.<br/>

### Frontend
This is an early version of the project so, for now there is not much to see here really.<br/>
However you can see some information displaying on the screen and some routes are already created.<br/>
<br/>
The *Frontend* preparation is easy. You just have to run ```npm install```.

### Starting the app
Both *Ruby on Rails* and *React* uses port 3000.<br/>
However, run the *Backend* with ```rails s``` and then, when you run *React* using ```npm start``` it will auto select another port.<br/><br/>
Is possible that running ```rails s``` throughs you an error the first time. The terminal will require you to run ```yarn install --check-files```. Do so and then you should be able to run the server as normally.<br/><br/>
In further commits, the installation guide may be updated if necessary. -->
