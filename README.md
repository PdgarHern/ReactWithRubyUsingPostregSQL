# React and Ruby on Rails Web App
Just a litle Anime info app using these technologies.

## First of all
To get this app running you'll need to *NodeJS*, *Ruby 2.6.8* with *Rails 6.1* and *PostgreSQL* (I use PostgreSQL 14).<br/>
Here you have some links:<br/>

## Get the app running
Once you have everything downloaded and installed you'll need to run a few things in the command prompt.<br/>
I recommend using the *Git Bash*. It's comfortable and shouldn't give you any problem.<br/>

## Backend
The Backend is created with Ruby on Rails and uses PostgreSQL for the database.<br/>
<br/>
In the *Backend* you need to run ```bundle install``` and ```rails db:setup```.<br/>
<br/>
Also, you will have to create a file called *application.yml* inside the *config* folder.<br/>
In that file, you will have to write the following:<br/>
```
development:
  host_postgres: your_host
  port_postgres: "your_port"
  username_postgres: your_user
  password_postgres: your_password
```
This is done this way for security reasons.<br/>
<br/>
If you want to insert some test data into the database I recomend using Postman.<br/>

## Frontend
This is an early version of the project so, for now there is not much to see here really.<br/>
However you can see some information displaying on the screen and some routes are already created.<br/>
<br/>
The *Frontend* preparation is easy. You just have to run ```npm install```.

## Starting the app
Both *Ruby on Rails* and *React* uses port 3000.
However, run the *Backend* with ```rails s``` and then, when you run *React* using ```npm start``` it will auto select another port.
In further commits, the installation guide may be updated if necessary.
